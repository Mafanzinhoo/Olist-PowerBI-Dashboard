# Olist-PowerBI-Dashboard
This was a personal project utilizing the Olist practice dataset for PowerBI. 

Designed an interactive dashboard analyzing 100k+ orders from a case dataset and established 5 key KPIs. Identified correlation between delivery delays and 16% drop in customer satisfaction.

KPIs were as such: 

1. Fullfillemtn Accuracy (On-Time Delivery & by month, year, and customer state)
* Percentage of deliveries that were on tinme. This was very high for deliveries that were delivered in under 15 days.

2. Logistics Cost Ratio (Freight % by Product Category Name)
* Measured the cost of delivery for each type of item.

3. Logistics Efficiency Matrix (Avg Delivery Days, Freight % and sum of payment value by customer state)
* Showed each state and the amount of turnover as well as the costs tha went to shipping from that turnover.

4. Customer Satisfaction Delay
* Graph showed the decay in reveiw score as the delivery time increased.

5. Average Delivery Days
* Showed the average time for deliveries across the board.
